// A binary search tree is a tree in which all the nodes follow the following properties:
// 1. The left sub-tree of a node has a key less than or equal to its parent node's key.
// 2. The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than to its parent node's key.

// Thus, BST divides all its subtrees in to two segments; the left sub-tree and the
// right sub-tree and can be defined as -
//
// left_subtree (keys) ≤  node (key)  ≤  right_subtree (keys)
