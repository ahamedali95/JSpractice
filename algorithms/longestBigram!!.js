// Write a function `longestBigram(sentence)` that takes in a sentence string and returns
// the longest bigram in the sentence. A bigram is a pair of consecutive words.
// When returning the bigram, include the space between the words.
// Assume there will be no punctuation. In the case of a tie, return the earlier bigram.
//
// Examples:
//
// longestBigram('measure twice cut once'); // => 'measure twice'
// longestBigram("One must have a mind of winter"); // => 'must have'
// longestBigram("go home to eat"); // => 'go home'
// longestBigram("his last assessment is fun"); // => 'last assessment'
