REMEMBER THESE PROBLEMS:
1. ANAGRAMS(STRINGS HAVE SAME CHARACTERS BUT IN DIFFERENT POSITION)
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS: FIND OUT WHETHER TWO STRINGS HAVE SAME CHARACTERS BUT IN DIFFERENT POSITION
2. BIOGRAMS(TWO CONSECUTIVE WORDS)
POSSIBLE PROBLEM: FIND OUT TWO CONSECUTIVE WORDS THAT MAY HAVE THE LONGEST LENGTH IN THE ENTIRE SENTENCE
3. ISOGRAMS(WORDS WHICH DO NOT HAVE REPEATED CHARACTERS)
POSSIBLE PROBLEM: CHECK WHETHER A GIVEN STRING IS AN ISOGRAM
4. FIBONACCI(1,1,2,3,...)
POSSIBLE PROBLEM:
A. FIND OUT THE FIBONACCI SEQUENCE WITH N NUMBERS
B. FIND OUT THE NTH NUMBER IN THE FIBONACCI SEQUENCE
POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
A. DYNAMICALLY USING FOR LOOP CONSTRUCT
B. RECURSION
5. FACTORIAL(0! = 1)
POSSIBLE PROBLEM:
A. FIND OUT THE FACTORIAL OF A GIVEN NUMBER
POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
A. DYNAMICALLY USING FOR LOOP CONSTRUCT
B. RECURSION
6. GREATEST COMMON FACTOR(A FACTOR IS AN INTEGER THAT DIVIDES ANOTHER INTERGER WITH NO DENOMINATOR)
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
FIND THE GREATEST OR SMALLEST COMMON FACTOR OF TWO NUMBERS
7. IS ARRAY SYMMETRICAL?
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
DOES THE ARRAY READ THE SAME FROM THE FRONT AND BACK?
8. ISPALINDROME
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
ARE WORDS READ THE SAME FROM THE FRONT AND BACK?
9. FINDING TRIPLETS OF AN ARRAY(THREE UNIQUE PAIRS)
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
FINDING THREE UNIQUE PAIRS FROM A COLLECTION WHEN ADDED OR MULTIPLIED PRODUCES A LARGEST VALUE
10. ALIQUOT SUM(SUM OF ALL FACTORS OF A NUMBER EXCLUDING ITSELF)
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
WE CAN USE THE ALIQUOT SUM TO DEFINE A SPECIAL SEQUENCE, CALLED THE ALIQUOT SEQUENCE. THE ALIQUOT SEQUENCE OF A NUMBER BEGINS WITH THE NUMBER ITSELF. THE SECOND NUMBER IN THE SEQUENCE IS THE FIRST NUMBER'S ALIQUOT SUM, THE THIRD NUMBER IS THE SECOND NUMBER'S ALIQUOT SUM, AND SO ON.
11. PAIR SUM(A PAIR IN A COLLECTION THAT ADDS TO THE TARGET)
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
FIND OUT A PAIR THAT ADDS TO THE TARGET
12. ISPRIME(A PRIME IS AN INTEGER GREATER THAN 1 THAT DIVIDES BY ITSELF AND 1 ONLY)
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
A. FIND OUT WHETHER A INTEGER A PRIME OR NOT
B. REPLACE EACH NUMBER IN THE ARRAY WITH THE NEXT PRIME AND RETURN IT
13. PASCAL TRIANGLE
