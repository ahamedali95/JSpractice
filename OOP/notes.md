# Object Oriented Programming

In object oriented programming, objects are key to understanding
object-oriented technology.

### What is an object?

An object is a real word-entity that contains
state and behavior. For example, dogs have state(name, color, breed, hungry)
and dogs have behavior(eating, barking).

### What is a class?

A class is a blueprint or prototype that defines the variables and methods common
to all objects of a certain kind.

### The Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns

The single responsibility principle is the idea that classes in object oriented
programming should have one job, one responsibility, and their services (i.e., methods)
should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility. This principle goes hand in
hand with the separation of concerns––the idea that the various responsibilities,
or concerns, of a computer program should be separated out into discrete sections.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation refers to enclosing all the functionalities of an object within
that object so that the object’s internal workings (its methods and properties)
are hidden from the rest of the application. This allows us to abstract or localize
specific set of functionalities on objects.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is one of the tenets of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
It is the practice of designing objects to share behaviors and to be able to
override shared behaviors with specific ones. Polymorphism takes advantage of
inheritance in order to make this happen.
