# Object Oriented Programming

In object oriented programming, objects are key to understanding
object-oriented technology.

### What is an object?

An object is a real word-entity that contains
state and behavior. For example, dogs have state(name, color, breed, hungry)
and dogs have behavior(eating, barking).

### What is a class?

A class is a blueprint or prototype that defines the variables and methods common
to all objects of a certain kind.

### The Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns

The single responsibility principle is the idea that classes in object oriented
programming should have one job, one responsibility, and their services (i.e., methods)
should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility. This principle goes hand in
hand with the separation of concerns––the idea that the various responsibilities,
or concerns, of a computer program should be separated out into discrete sections.
